# Use the Subnets Screen

The **Subnets** screen in the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) lists each subnet associated with the account, along with specific information regarding the subnet, including its VLAN, location, and total number of IP addresses. Follow these steps to view the **Subnets** screen.

1. Enter the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/) using your unique credentials.
2. Select **Network > IP Management > Subnets** from the Navigation Bar to display the **Subnets** screen.

## What Happens Next

On the **Subnets** screen, each subnet associated with the account is displayed within the list of subnets. From this screen, you may view a subnet or VLAN's details, edit notes for a subnet, or order additional IP addresses.

# Global IP FAQ
{: #global-ip-faq}


## How long does it take for my new Global IP to appear on my account after it has been ordered?
{: #faq-global-ip-new-appear} 
{: faq}

It takes approximately five (5) minutes for a Global IP to appear after it has been ordered.


## Can I convert one of my pre-existing static IPs to a Global IP?
{: #faq-global-ip-convert-static-global} 
{: faq}

Not at this time. {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} requires all Global IP address to be newly provisioned IPs, so we donâ€™t allow pre-existing IP addresses to be converted into Global IPs.


## How long does it take for my Global IP to associate to an instance?
{: #faq-global-ip-associate-instance} 
{: faq}

The amount of time it takes for your Global IP to associate depends on if you are associating a Global IP for the first time or if you are transferring the Global IP to a new instance. For new Global IPs, it takes approximately five (5) minutes before the address may be linked to an instance. When transferring an existing Global IP between instances, it takes less than one (1) minute.


## What types of subnets are available with Global IPs?
{: #faq-global-ip-subnet-types} 
{: faq}

We currently offer Global IP addresses as both IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses. Our Global IPv4 addresses are available as single /32 addresses, while our Global IPv6 addresses are available as single /64 addresses.


## Can IPv4 and IPv6 Global IPs be used interchangeably?
{: #faq-global-ip-ipv4-ipv6-interchangeably} 
{: faq}

Because of incompatibility between IP address styles, using IPv4 and IPv6 Global IPs interchangeably is not an option.


## What is a Global IP?
{: #faq-what-is-global-ip} 
{: faq}

A Global IP is a static IP address that can be transferred between Bare Metal Servers or Virtual Servers associated with the account that owns the subnet. Global IPs can be moved to any compatible device or instance on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} network.


## How many Global IP addresses may I order?
{: #faq-global-ip-how-many} 
{: faq}

Each account may have up to five (5) single Global IP addresses. Global IPs may be either IPv4 or IPv6, or a combination of the two.


## How much will it cost to add a Global IP to my account?
{: #faq-global-ip-how-much}

# Global IP FAQ

<a name="236"></a>
## How long does it take for my new Global IP to appear on my account after it has been ordered?

It takes approximately five (5) minutes for a Global IP to appear after it has been ordered.

## Can I convert one of my pre-existing static IPs to a Global IP?

Not at this time. {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} requires all Global IP address to be newly provisioned IPs, so we donâ€™t allow pre-existing IP addresses to be converted into Global IPs.

## How long does it take for my Global IP to associate to an instance?

The amount of time it takes for your Global IP to associate depends on if you are associating a Global IP for the first time or if you are transferring the Global IP to a new instance. For new Global IPs, it takes approximately five (5) minutes before the address may be linked to an instance. When transferring an existing Global IP between instances, it takes less than one (1) minute.

We currently offer Global IP addresses as both IPv4 addresses and IPv6 addresses. Our Global IPv4 addresses are available as single /32 addresses, while our Global IPv6 addresses are available as single /64 addresses.

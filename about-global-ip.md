# About Global IP addresses

A Global IP is a static IP address that can be transferred between {{site.data.keyword.baremetal_short}} or {{site.data.keyword.virtualmachinesshort}} associated with the account that owns the subnet. Global IPs can be moved to any compatible device on the {{site.data.keyword.BluSoftlayer_notm}} network.

Global IP addresses provide IP flexibility. They allow users to shift workloads between servers, even in different datacenters. Global IPs also provide IP persistence by allowing for transitions between servers and Virtual Server Instances (VSIs). For example, you can upgrade from a VSI to a dedicated system without having your IP tied to a particular server or VLAN.

## How to order Global IP addresses (IPs)

To order Global IPs:

1. From your browser, open the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/){: new_window} and log into your account.
2. In the Customer Portal navigation, select **Network > IP Management > Subnets**.
3. Click on the **Order IP Addresses** link.
4. From the dropdown menu, choose **Global IPv4** or **Global IPv6** as needed, and click **Continue** to start the ordering process. The IPs will be added within minutes.

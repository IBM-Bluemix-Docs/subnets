# Unroute a Global IP Address from a Device

Global IP addresses may be manually unrouted by the user at any time. Follow the steps below to unroute a Global IP address from a device.

1. Navigate to the Global IP screen on the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/). Refer to [Display the Global IP Screen](display-global-ip-screen.html){:new_window}.
* Select the Global IP Address to be unrouted.
* Select the **Clear** button.
* Select the **Update** button to complete the unroute process, or select **Cancel** to cancel the action and return to the **Subnets** screen.

## What Happens Next

After you unroute a Global IP from a device, the Global IP is no longer associated with that device. After the Global IP unroute process is complete, that Global IP address may be [rerouted](route-global-ip-to-device.html) to any other device on the account.

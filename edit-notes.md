The **Subnets** screen within the [{{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} console](https://{DomainName}/){: new_window} displays all subnets associated with the account, and it shows all corresponding details regarding each subnet, including the network, VLAN, location and notes. The **Notes** section of the screen is editable. It may be updated by any user who has permission to interact with subnets.

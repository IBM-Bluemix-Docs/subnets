# Edit Notes for a Subnet

The **Subnets** screen within the [Customer Portal](https://control.softlayer.com/){:new_window} displays all subnets associated with the account, and it shows all corresponding details regarding each subnet, including the network, VLAN, location and notes. The **Notes** section of the screen is editable. It may be updated by any user who has permission to interact with subnets. We recommend keeping the **Notes** section updated with details about the subnet, which may include the intended use for the subnet and any other pertinent information to assist users. Follow the steps in this article to edit notes for a subnet.


* Navigate to the **Subnets** screen in the [Customer Portal ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://control.softlayer.com/). Refer to [Using the Subnets Screen](subnets-screen.html){:new_window}.
* Click anywhere within the **Notes** column for the desired subnet to open the field for edits.
* Enter the **desired notes or comments** in the **Notes** field.
* Click away from the Notes column to save the edits.

## What Happens Next

After updating notes for a subnet, the notes remain with the subnet until they are edited again. Subnet notes may be edited at any time by repeating these steps.
